Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis
This repository contains the analysis and Power BI dashboard for a project focused on identifying the key drivers of airline passenger satisfaction.

Objective
The primary goal of this project was to analyze passenger survey data to uncover the top pain points and strengths in the airline's service. The analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations to improve the overall customer experience, reduce dissatisfaction, and identify trends in traveler demographics and preferences.

Dataset
The analysis was performed on the Airline Passenger Satisfaction dataset, which includes passenger feedback on various aspects of the travel experience, such as in-flight service, booking, and airport convenience.

Key Variables: Ticket class, customer demographics, travel purpose (business vs. personal), and first-time vs. returning travelers.

Tools & Technologies
Data Transformation: Power Query

Data Visualization & Dashboarding: Power BI

Key DAX Functions: Utilized for creating calculated columns and measures.

Analysis & Key Findings
Process
The analysis involved several key techniques:

Data Transformation: Standardized data formats, pivoted columns for better aggregation, and created new calculated columns in Power Query.

Likert Scale Visualization: Used specialized charts to effectively display satisfaction levels (rated 1-5) across different service categories.

Comparative Analysis: Examined satisfaction differences between key passenger segments, such as business vs. personal and first-time vs. returning travelers.

Key Findings
Top Drivers of Satisfaction: The analysis identified in-flight service, baggage handling, and seat comfort as the most significant factors contributing to a positive passenger experience.

Top Passenger Complaints: Conversely, in-flight Wi-Fi service, gate location convenience, and ease of online booking were the most common sources of dissatisfaction.

Demographic Insights:

Business travelers constitute a significant majority, making up 70% of all passengers.

A high dissatisfaction rate of 70% among first-time travelers points to a critical need for a smoother and more welcoming initial experience.

Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following actionable recommendations were developed:

Improve Online Booking Experience: Redesign the booking app and website to be more user-friendly and conduct usability testing to ensure a seamless process.

Enhance Airport Navigation: Integrate a real-time airport navigation feature into the mobile app to provide step-by-step directions to gates.

Upgrade In-Flight Wi-Fi: Partner with leading providers to improve network reliability and introduce tiered pricing models (e.g., free basic messaging, paid streaming).

Address Travel Delays: Conduct an in-depth analysis of historical flight data to identify common causes of delays and improve real-time communication with passengers.

Next Steps
Conduct A/B testing on the new booking system.

Monitor Wi-Fi performance and gather feedback on the proposed tiered pricing model.
